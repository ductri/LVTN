This systematic review aims to evaluate the benefit and side effect of Xuezhikang for coronary heart disease (CHD) complicated by dyslipidemia. Methods. All randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with Xuezhikang as a treatment for CHD combined with dyslipidemia were considered for inclusion. Data extraction and analyses and quality assessment were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. Results. We included 22 randomized trials. Xuezhikang showed significant benefit on the incidence of all-cause deaths, CHD deaths, myocardial infarction, and revascularization as compared with placebo based on conventional treatment for CHD. It remarkably lowered total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) as compared with the placebo or inositol nicotinate group, which was similar to statins group. Xuezhikang also raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared to placebo or no intervention, which was similar to Inositol nicotinate and slightly inferior to statins. The incidence of adverse events did not differ between the Xuezhikang and control group. Conclusions. Xuezhikang showed a comprehensive lipid-regulating effect and was safe and effective in reducing cardiovascular events in CHD patients complicated by dyslipidemia.

"Benefits of niacin in patients with versus without the metabolic syndrome and healed myocardial infarction (from the Coronary Drug Project).";"his post hoc analysis from the Coronary Drug Project (CDP) evaluated the effects of niacin monotherapy on clinical outcomes in patients with and without the metabolic syndrome (MS). The CDP was a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of lipid-modifying agents in men with previous myocardial infarction (MI). Of the 5 drug regimens, only niacin significantly decreased definite recurrent nonfatal MI at 6 years and total mortality at a 15-year follow-up. Patients treated with niacin (n = 1,119) and placebo (n = 2,787) were grouped according to the presence or absence of the MS at baseline. The MS was defined on the basis of meeting > or =3 of 5 criteria from the current National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines in a small subgroup of patients with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol determinations at baseline and on the basis of > or =3 of 4 criteria in the total population, excluding the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol criterion. Niacin decreased the occurrence of 6-year MI and 15-year total mortality similarly among patients with or without the MS. For example, in the total population, 15-year total mortality rates were 60% and 64% (hazard ratio 0.86) in patients with the MS treated with niacin and placebo, respectively, and 50% and 57% (hazard ratio 0.86) in those without the MS (Z for interaction = 0.06, indicating homogeneity of the treatment effect across groups).

"Meta-analysis of carvedilol versus beta 1 selective beta-blockers (atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, and nebivolol).";"ecause carvedilol is a unique vasodilating ? blocker (BB) exerting antioxidant activity and pleiotropic effects, it was theorized that it may confer more potent beneficial effects on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and heart failure (HF) settings. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of randomized, controlled, direct-comparison trials that included adults receiving atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, nebivolol, or carvedilol to evaluate the effects of carvedilol compared to other BBs on mortality, cardiovascular events, and hospital readmissions in the setting of AMI or systolic HF. Compared to ?(1)-selective BBs used in HF (8 trials, n = 4,563), carvedilol significantly reduced all-cause mortality (risk ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.93, p = 0.0006). In 3 trials of patients with AMI (n = 644), carvedilol significantly reduced all-cause mortality by 45% (fixed-effects model: risk ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.94, p = 0.03, random-effects model: risk ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.26 to 1.12, p = 0.10), with no reduction in non-fatal MI (risk ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 1.22, p = 0.16). In conclusion, carvedilol, as compared against atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol and nebivolol in randomized direct comparison trials, significantly reduced all-cause mortality in systolic HF patients. Additionally, carvedilol significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared with ?(1)-selective BBs in AMI patients using the fixed-effects model but not using the random-effects model.

"Pharmacologic management of chronic low back pain: synthesis of the evidence.";"Opioids and NSAIDs are effective for chronic LBP, while antidepressants have no meaningful clinical benefit. Based on the significant rate of side effects with opioids and the lack of convincing superiority over NSAIDs, opioids are not recommended as a treatment for chronic LBP. Attention to subgroups of patients will likely help guide treatment, and will likely help increase the clinical impact of future research. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommendation 1: NSAIDs should be considered as a treatment of chronic LBP (Strength: Strong). There is evidence demonstrating favorable effectiveness, but also significant side effects that may have meaningful clinical consequences. Recommendation 2: Opioids may be considered in the treatment of chronic LBP but should be avoided if possible (Strength: Weak). There is evidence demonstrating favorable effectiveness compared to placebo, similar effectiveness compared to NSAIDs, and with significant side effects including decreasing effectiveness related to habituation when used long-term. Recommendation 3: Antidepressants should not be routinely used for the treatment of chronic LBP (Strength: Strong). There is evidence that they are not more effective than placebo with respect to pain, functional status, or depression. Based on the hypothesis that chronic LBP is a symptom reflective of a heterogeneous group of disorders, categorization of certain patient specific subgroups may be helpful in guiding future treatment decision making. It is likely that inclusion of subgroup factors in future RCTs will provide information needed to improve the strength and specificity of future clinical recommendations.";"2016-08-08 10:41:37"

"Prognostic impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in diastolic heart failure.";"he angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has a well defined place in the treatment of systolic heart failure (HF). Evidence for routine prescription of an ACE inhibitor in patients with diastolic HF (DHF) is inconsistent. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the prognostic impact of ACE inhibitor in patients with DHF. The present prospective study included patients with normal or slightly impaired ejection fraction (> or =50%) surviving a first hospitalization for HF. We assessed the long-term prognosis of these patients according to prescription of an ACE inhibitor at discharge. ACE inhibitor therapy prescribed at discharge in 46% (n = 165) of the 358 included patients was associated with a 30% relative decrease in the risk of 5-year mortality (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.93, p = 0.013). On multivariable Cox analysis, the relation between ACE inhibitor prescription and mortality remained significant (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.99, p = 0.045). Using propensity score analysis, 120 patients receiving an ACE inhibitor were matched with 120 patients not receiving this medication. In the postmatch group, prescription of ACE inhibitor was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of 5-year mortality (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.87, p = 0.006). Five-year relative survival (observed/expected survival) of the ACE inhibitor group was better than that of the no-ACE inhibitor group (65% vs 57%). In conclusion, we demonstrate that in this cohort of patients with DHF, prescription of ACE inhibitor was associated with a significant decrease in long-term mortality.";"2016-08-08 17:29:17"

This study was designed to evaluate the effects of the antioxidant flavonoid silymarin in improving long-term and postprandial glycemic and weight control in type 2 diabetic patients treated with glibenclamide. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 59 type 2 diabetic patients, previously maintained on 10 mg/day glibenclamide and diet control, with poor glycemic control, were randomized into three groups: the first two groups were treated with either 200 mg/day silymarin or placebo as adjuncts to glibenclamide, and the third group was maintained on glibenclamide alone for 120 days. Fasting and 4-hour postprandial plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated at baseline and after 120 days. Compared with placebo, silymarin treatment significantly reduced both fasting and postprandial plasma glucose excursions, in addition to significantly reducing HbA(1c) levels and BMI after 120 days. No significantly different effects were observed for placebo compared to glibenclamide alone. In conclusion, adjunct use of silymarin with glibenclamide improves the glycemic control targeted by glibenclamide, during both fasting and postprandially, an effect that may be related to increased insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.";"2016-08-08 11:29:45"

"Testosterone and prostate safety.";"or several decades it has been assumed that higher testosterone (T) leads to greater growth of benign and malignant prostate tissue, but this view has come under greater scrutiny over the last several years. Although there are as yet no large-scale, long-term controlled studies of T therapy to provide a definitive assessment of risk, numerous smaller clinical trials as well as population-based longitudinal studies consistently fail to support the historical idea that T therapy poses an increased risk of prostate cancer or exacerbation of symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. This lack of prostate risk despite increased serum T appears to be explained by data showing that exogenous T does not raise intraprostatic concentrations of T or dihydrotestosterone, suggesting a saturation model. In contrast, there is mounting evidence that low serum T is associated with greater prostate cancer risk, and more worrisome features of prostate cancer. In conclusion, the available evidence strongly suggests that T therapy is safe for the prostate. Given that the population at risk for T deficiency overlaps with the population at risk for prostate cancer, it is strongly recommended that men undergoing T therapy undergo regular monitoring for prostate cancer.";"2016-08-08 17:29:17"
"Testosterone therapy in adult men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline.";"We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and in some patients by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using accurate assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for symptomatic men with androgen deficiency, who have low testosterone levels, to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 3 ng/ml without further urological evaluation, erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 50%), hyperviscosity, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) greater than 19, or class III or IV heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost.

Many statin-intolerant patients use alternative lipid-lowering therapies, including red yeast rice. The present trial evaluated the tolerability of red yeast rice versus pravastatin in patients unable to tolerate other statins because of myalgia. The study was conducted in a community-based setting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 43 adults with dyslipidemia and a history of statin discontinuation because of myalgia were randomly assigned to red yeast rice 2,400 mg twice daily or pravastatin 20 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. All subjects were concomitantly enrolled in a 12-week therapeutic lifestyle change program. The primary outcomes included the incidence of treatment discontinuation because of myalgia and a daily pain severity score. The secondary outcomes were muscle strength and plasma lipids. The incidence of withdrawal from medication owing to myalgia was 5% (1 of 21) in the red yeast rice group and 9% (2 of 22) in the pravastatin group (p = 0.99). The mean pain severity did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. No difference was found in muscle strength between the 2 groups at week 4 (p = 0.61), week 8 (p = 0.81), or week 12 (p = 0.82). The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level decreased 30% in the red yeast rice group and 27% in the pravastatin group. In conclusion, red yeast rice was tolerated as well as pravastatin and achieved a comparable reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a population previously intolerant to statins.

The prognostic value of elevated circulating levels of cardiac Troponins seen during COPD exacerbations has been investigated. From the Akershus hospital database, 897 patients discharged after treatment for COPD exacerbation in the period 2000-2003 were identified and followed-up until June 30, 2005. Median observation time was 1.9 yrs. In 396 patients, measurements of cardiac-specific troponin T (cTnT) were available. Levels of cTnT >/=0.04 mug.L(-1) were considered elevated. Clinical data were retrieved from patient records and date of death was obtained from the Norwegian National Registry. In order to balance the nonrandomised nature of available cTnT measurements, an exposure propensity score (EPS) for cTnT sampling was calculated and used in regression analyses. After adjusting for EPS in Cox regression analyses, elevated cTnT was significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality in the observation period, with a hazard ratio of 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.15-2.34). In conclusion, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with elevated cardiac-specific Troponin T during exacerbation are at increased risk of death after discharge.";"2016-08-08 11:29:45"

"Vaginal birth after cesarean delivery: an admission scoring system.";"Increasing scores correlate with increasing probability of vaginal birth after cesarean. The admission vaginal birth after cesarean scoring system may be useful in counseling patients regarding the option of vaginal birth or repeat cesarean delivery. This information could be particularly valuable for the patient who opts for trial of labor but has second thoughts about her mode of birth when labor begins.";"2016-08-08 10:41:37"

"Validity of electron beam computed tomography for coronary artery disease: asystematic review and meta-analysis.";"Increasing EBCT scores indicate higher risk for CAD in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. In general, asymptomatic patients with EBCT scores in the high category can perhaps be considered for preventive medical therapy and risk factor modification. Symptomatic patients with EBCT scores in the low category can perhaps, at least temporarily, avoid invasive coronary angiography. However, the non-uniform quality of studies and the lack of availability of individual-level data preclude the extension of our results to individual patients.";"2016-08-08 17:29:17"
"Vitamin D2 dose required to rapidly increase 25OHD levels in osteoporotic women.";"The oral dose of vitamin D(2) required to rapidly achieve adequate levels of 25OHD is seemingly much higher than the usual recommended vitamin D(3) dose (20 mug/day). During 3 months, 250 microg/day of vitamin D(2) most effectively raised 25OHD levels to 85 nmol/l in 75% of the postmenopausal osteopenic/osteoporotic women treated.";"2016-08-08 17:29:17"

"Yoga on our minds: a systematic review of yoga for neuropsychiatric disorders.";"There is emerging evidence from randomized trials to support popular beliefs about yoga for depression, sleep disorders, and as an augmentation therapy. Limitations of literature include inability to do double-blind studies, multiplicity of comparisons within small studies, and lack of replication. Biomarker and neuroimaging studies, those comparing yoga with standard pharmaco- and psychotherapies, and studies of long-term efficacy are needed to fully translate the promise of yoga for enhancing mental health.";"2016-08-08 11:29:45"

71,"Niacin decreased the occurrence of 6-year MI and 15-year total mortality similarly among patients with or without the MS. For example, in the total population, 15-year total mortality rates were 60% and 64% (hazard ratio 0.86) in patients with the MS treated with niacin and placebo, respectively, and 50% and 57% (hazard ratio 0.86) in those without the MS (Z for interaction = 0.06, indicating homogeneity of the treatment effect across groups).",1

80,"Whole-grain intake, largely attributed to the cereal fiber, is inversely associated with HOMA-IR and a lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome.",0
81,Dietary glycemic index is positively associated with HOMA-IR and prevalence of the metabolic syndrome.,0
82,"Given that both a high cereal fiber content and lower glycemic index are attributes of whole-grain foods, recommendation to increase whole-grain intake may reduce the risk of developing the metabolic syndrome.",0
83,"The results of this study demonstrate that intake of 1, 3, or 6 g of cinnamon per day reduces serum glucose, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol in people with type 2 diabetes and suggest that the inclusion of cinnamon in the diet of people with type 2 diabetes will reduce risk factors associated with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.",0

419,Type or intensity of 14 months of treatment for ADHD in childhood (at age 7.0-9.9 years) does not predict functioning 6 to 8 years later.,0
420,"This finding implies that children with behavioral and sociodemographic advantage, with the best response to any treatment, will have the best long-term prognosis.",0
421,"As a group, however, despite initial symptom improvement during treatment that is largely maintained after treatment, children with combined-type ADHD exhibit significant impairment in adolescence.",1
422,"Although in this retrospective study patients with severe disease may have been more inclined to respond, we may conclude that the study results indicate a very refractory course of chronic urticaria in patients visiting a specialized dermatological unit.",0
423,"The study is not comparable with studies in patients visiting a general practitioner or a dermatology unit in a general hospital, but highlights the chronicity of the disease in this subgroup of patients with severe urticaria.",0
424,"In those patients with migraine, the most common reasons for misdiagnosis include headache triggers, pain location, and associated features (""guilt by provocation, location, and association"") commonly attributed to sinus headache.",0
425,The clinician must be aware of these unique presentations of migraine so that a correct diagnosis can be made and effective treatment instituted.,0
426,"A portion of patients with self-diagnosed sinus headache suffer from a headache type, which is unclassifiable by the current IHS criteria.",0
427,"These headaches are characterized by bilateral maxillary pressure, mild to moderate pain intensity, cranial autonomic symptoms, and the complete absence of migraine features.",0
428,NNS significantly decreases some elements of measurable physiologic pain response of the neonate during circumcision.,1
429,The present trial evaluated the tolerability of red yeast rice versus pravastatin in patients unable to tolerate other statins because of myalgia.,0
430,"A total of 43 adults with dyslipidemia and a history of statin discontinuation because of myalgia were randomly assigned to red yeast rice 2,400 mg twice daily or pravastatin 20 mg twice daily for 12 weeks.",1
431,The primary outcomes included the incidence of treatment discontinuation because of myalgia and a daily pain severity score.,0
432,The incidence of withdrawal from medication owing to myalgia was 5% (1 of 21) in the red yeast rice group and 9% (2 of 22) in the pravastatin group (p = 0.99).,0
433,"No difference was found in muscle strength between the 2 groups at week 4 (p = 0.61), week 8 (p = 0.81), or week 12 (p = 0.82).",0
434,The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level decreased 30% in the red yeast rice group and 27% in the pravastatin group.,0
435,"In conclusion, red yeast rice was tolerated as well as pravastatin and achieved a comparable reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a population previously intolerant to statins.",0
436,The application of topical pimecrolimus is ineffective in the treatment of ongoing Toxicodendron-induced ACD.,1
437,This was true at higher dosage (850 mg twice daily) and lower dosage (250 mg twice or 3 times daily); in people of varied ethnicity; and even when a sensitivity analysis was applied to the data.,2
438,"Results suggest that, to maximise the benefits of available asthma medication and to improve health outcomes, further efforts should be made to convince the parents of asthmatic children not to smoke in the house, and to improve compliance by increasing the patients' understanding of the disease and its treatment.",0
439,This study demonstrated that an extract of jewelweed was not effective in the treatment of poison ivy/oak allergic contact dermatitis.,0
440,"Among pregnant women, the highest risk period for venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism in particular is during the postpartum period.",0
441,"Although the incidence of pulmonary embolism has decreased over time, the incidence of deep venous thrombosis remains unchanged, indicating the need to better identify pregnant women at increased risk.",1
442,The prognostic value of elevated circulating levels of cardiac Troponins seen during COPD exacerbations has been investigated.,0
443,"From the Akershus hospital database, 897 patients discharged after treatment for COPD exacerbation in the period 2000-2003 were identified and followed-up until June 30, 2005.",1
444,Clinical data were retrieved from patient records and date of death was obtained from the Norwegian National Registry.,1
445,"In order to balance the nonrandomised nature of available cTnT measurements, an exposure propensity score (EPS) for cTnT sampling was calculated and used in regression analyses.",0
446,"After adjusting for EPS in Cox regression analyses, elevated cTnT was significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality in the observation period, with a hazard ratio of 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.15-2.34).",0
447,"In conclusion, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with elevated cardiac-specific Troponin T during exacerbation are at increased risk of death after discharge.",0
448,This is the largest severe sepsis study reporting an association between elevated cTnI and higher mortality.,0
449,"Patient age, height, obesity-related diagnoses, and magnitude and frequency of abnormal blood pressure readings all increased the odds of diagnosis.",0
450,These findings provide a means of early stratification of hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics according to their risk for nosocomial C. difficile diarrhea.,1
451,Patients with severe to extremely severe disease at the time of admission may benefit from careful monitoring of antibiotic prescribing and early attention to infection control issues.,1
452,"In the future, these ""high-risk"" patients may benefit from prophylaxis studies of novel agents being developed to prevent C. difficile diarrhea.",0
453,"Cryotherapy is an effective, low-risk approach to keloid treatment associated with a low rate of recurrence.",0
454,The results suggest that the use of a pedometer is associated with significant increases in physical activity and significant decreases in body mass index and blood pressure.,0
455,The admission vaginal birth after cesarean scoring system may be useful in counseling patients regarding the option of vaginal birth or repeat cesarean delivery.,1
456,This information could be particularly valuable for the patient who opts for trial of labor but has second thoughts about her mode of birth when labor begins.,1
457,This tool may be used in early prenatal care to facilitate the decision of whether to undergo a trial of labor.,1
458,The previously published prediction model for VBAC developed in the USA is also available to Japanese women.,1
459,"In general, asymptomatic patients with EBCT scores in the high category can perhaps be considered for preventive medical therapy and risk factor modification.",0
460,"Symptomatic patients with EBCT scores in the low category can perhaps, at least temporarily, avoid invasive coronary angiography.",0
461,"However, the non-uniform quality of studies and the lack of availability of individual-level data preclude the extension of our results to individual patients.",0
462,The oral dose of vitamin D(2) required to rapidly achieve adequate levels of 25OHD is seemingly much higher than the usual recommended vitamin D(3) dose (20 mug/day).,1
463,"During 3 months, 250 microg/day of vitamin D(2) most effectively raised 25OHD levels to 85 nmol/l in 75% of the postmenopausal osteopenic/osteoporotic women treated.",2
464,Most recommendations in this guideline are based on observational studies and extrapolation from other populations.,1

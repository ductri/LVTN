For

34
the

47
No
48
statistical
49
difference
50
was
51
found
52
in
53
the

in

72
These

need

to

be

replicated
78
before
79
citalopram
80

102
We

that

HCTZ

113
generally
114

There
133
is

a

138
in

140

144
which
145
is
146

148
does
149
not
150

163
more

165
one

177
or
178
that
179
relapsed
180
after

182
The
183
factors
184
predicting

188
were
189
sensitization

together
207
with

suggest

that

567
We

582
When

we
584
compared

586
with

589
there

was

less

628
These

should

be

677
In

the

outcome
681
of

684
we
685
found
686
that
687
these

689
were
690
dependent
691
on
692
the
693
continuation
694

697
In

699
in

701
antisocial

708
independent

712
In
713
addition,
714
regardless
715
of
716
psychiatric

718
ADHD
719
placed
720
children

at
722
relative
723
risk
724
for
725
educational
726
and
727

728
disadvantage.
729
The
730

731
do
732
not

support
734
a

very
757
low

759
of

780
than
781

or
784
no

786
The

788
of
789
symptoms
790
associated
791
with
792
recurrent

795
may
796
or
797
may
798
not

correspond
800
to
801
clinical
802
improvement,
803
and
804
these
805
two
806
topical

830
we
831
recommend
832
that
833
a
834
local

anesthetic
836
be
837
administered
838
in
839
advance
840
of

circumcision
842
and
843
that
844
the
845
Mogen
846
procedure
847
be
848
used,
849
unless
850
contraindicated.
851
We
852
also
853
recommend
854
that
855
infants
856
be
857
given
858
a
859
sweetened
860
pacifier
861
before,
862
during,
863
and
864
after

circumcision
866
if
867
the

880
management
881
of

884
may

prevent

Careful

seems
922
to

be
924
a

successful

approach
927
to
928
the

of

938
Ankyloglossia,
939
which
940
is
941
a
942
relatively
943
common
944
finding
945
in
946
the

948
population,
949
adversely
950
affects
951
breastfeeding
952
in
953
selected

infants.
955
Neither
956
an
957
antibiotic
958
nor
959
a
960
topical
961
steroid
962
alone
963
or
964
in
965
combination
966
was
967
effective
968
as
969
a
970
treatment
971
for
972
acute
973
sinusitis
974
in
975
the
976
primary
977

978
setting.
979
Currently
980
there
981
are
982
relatively
983
few
984
studies
985
of
986
antidepressants
987
for
988
the
989
treatment
990
of
991
agitation
992
and
993
psychosis
994
in
995
dementia.
996
The
997
SSRIs
998
sertraline
999
and
1000
citalopram
1001
were
1002
associated
1003
with
1004
a
1005
reduction
1006
in
1007
symptoms
1008
of
1009
agitation
1010
when
1011
compared
1012
to
1013
placebo
1014
in
1015
two
1016
studies.
1017
Both
1018
SSRIs
1019
and
1020
trazodone
1021
appear
1022
to
1023
be
1024
tolerated
1025
reasonably
1026
well
1027
when
1028
compared
1029
to
1030
placebo,
1031
typical
1032
antipsychotics
1033
and
1034
atypical
1035
antipsychotics.
1036
Future
1037
studies
1038
involving
1039
more
1040
subjects
1041
are
1042
required
1043
to
1044
determine
1045
if
1046
SSRIs,
1047
trazodone,
1048
or
1049
other
1050
antidepressants
1051
are
1052
safe
1053
and
1054
effective
1055
treatments
1056
for
1057
agitation
1058
and
1059
psychosis
1060
in
1061
dementia.
1062
Evidence
1063
suggests
1064
that
1065
the
1066
mode
1067
of
1068
action
1069
of
1070
bupropion
1071
and
1072
nortriptyline
1073
is
1074
independent
1075
of
1076
their
1077
antidepressant
1078
effect
1079
and
1080
that
1081
they
1082
are
1083
of
1084
similar
1085
efficacy
1086
to
1087
nicotine
1088
replacement.
1089
Evidence
1090
also
1091
suggests
1092
that
1093
bupropion
1094
is
1095
less
1096
effective
1097
than
1098
varenicline,
1099
but
1100
further
1101
research
1102
is
1103
needed
1104
to
1105
confirm
1106
this
1107
finding.
1108
Atypical
1109
antipsychotic
1110
use
1111
is
1112
associated
1113
with
1114
an
1115
increased
1116
risk
1117
for
1118
death
1119
compared
1120
with
1121
nonuse
1122
among
1123
older
1124
adults
1125
with
1126
dementia.
1127
The
1128
risk
1129
for
1130
death
1131
may
1132
be
1133
greater
1134
with
1135
conventional
1136
antipsychotics
1137
than
1138
with
1139
atypical
1140
antipsychotics.
1141
There
1142
is
1143
no
1144
consistent
1145
evidence
1146
that
1147
anxiolytics
1148
aid
1149
smoking
1150
cessation,
1151
but
1152
the
1153
available
1154
evidence
1155
does
1156
not
1157
rule
1158
out
1159
a
1160
possible
1161
effect.
1162
In
1163
this
1164
systematic
1165

1166
we
1167
present
1168
information
1169
relating
1170
to
1171
the
1172
effectiveness
1173
and
1174
safety
1175
of
1176
the
1177
following
1178
interventions:
1179
analgesics
1180
(local),
1181
carbenoxolone
1182
mouthwash,
1183
chlorhexidine
1184
(and

1193
The
1194
SFA

1196
is
1197
a

1202
measure
1203

1214
within

1217
We
1218
meta-analyzed
1219
more
1220
and
1221
newer
1222
research
1223

1224
and
1225
separated
1226

1227
according
1228
to

1231
to
1232
explore
1233
soy
1234
isoflavone-breast
1235
cancer
1236
association.
1237
We
1238
founded
1239
that
1240
soy
1241
isoflavone
1242
intake
1243
could
1244
lower
1245
the
1246
risk
1247
of
1248
breast
1249
cancer
1250
for
1251
both

and
1254
post-menopausal
1255
women
1256
in

Asian
1258

1259
However,
1260
for
1261
women
1262
in
1263
Western
1264
countries,
1265
pre-
1266
or
1267
post-menopausal,
1268
there
1269
is
1270
no
1271
evidence
1272
to
1273
suggest
1274
an
1275
association
1276
between
1277
intake
1278
of
1279
soy
1280
isoflavone
1281
and
1282
breast
1283

1284
The
1285
majority
1286
of
1287
infants
1288
with
1289
wheezing
1290
have
1291
transient
1292

1293
associated
1294
with
1295
diminished
1296
airway
1297
function
1298
at
1299
birth
1300
and
1301
do
1302

of

asthma
1308
or
1309

1310
later

1313
In
1314
a
1315
substantial
1316
minority
1317
of
1318
infants,
1319
however,
1320
wheezing
1321
episodes
1322
are
1323
probably
1324
related
1325
to
1326
a
1327
predisposition
1328
to
1329
asthma.

One
1331
week
1332
of

1341
experienced

by

1352
Based
1353
on

these
1355
findings
1356
and

1361
once-daily
1362
AzA

1365
can
1366
therefore
1367
be
1368
utilized
1369
as
1370
a
1371
safe,
1372

1384
Once-daily
1385
dosing
1386
of
1387
AzA
1388
15%

1390
was
1391
well

can

flexibility
1401
and
1402
convenience
1403
for
1404
the
1405

1406
as
1407
well
1408
as
1409
for
1410
the

1412
These
1413
bioflavonoids

improve
1415
early

1425
It
1426
can
1427
thus
1428
be
1429
concluded
1430
that
1431
in
1432
the

1550
In

conclusion,
1552
these

support
1555
the

1567
This
1568

1569
demonstrates
1570
that,
1571
when

1653
At

overall
2081
finding
2082
from

this

2085
is
2086
that

the

2107
this

the

2114

that

the

that

Intensive

2868
early

to

a

2875
in
2876
clinical

2878
at

30

2887
In
2888
stable
2889
patients,
2890
intensive
2891
statin

provides

long-term

2904
Thus,
2905
ACS

should
2908
be

in

2967
are
2968
important

for

the

has
2989
a
2990
narrower

2993
suggesting
2994
that
2995
factors
2996
influencing
2997
wheezing
2998
symptom
2999
expression
3000
may
3001
differ
3002
from
3003
those
3004
predisposing

3007
to
3008

3009
The
3010
present
3011
study
3012
suggests
3013
that
3014
childhood
3015
ADHD
3016
predisposes
3017
to
3018
specific
3019
disadvantages
3020
and
3021
continues
3022
to
3023
affect
3024
important
3025
functional
3026
domains
3027
unrelated
3028
to
3029
current
3030
psychiatric
3031
diagnosis.
3032
These
3033
findings
3034
indicate
3035
that
3036
ADHD
3037
is
3038
associated
3039
with
3040
significant
3041
educational
3042
and
3043
occupational
3044
underattainments
3045
relative
3046
to
3047
what
3048
would
3049
have
3050
been
3051
expected
3052
on
3053
the
3054
basis
3055
of
3056
intellectual
3057
potential.
3058
This
3059
analysis
3060
is
3061
consistent
3062
with
3063
prior
3064
reports
3065
showing
3066
that
3067
ACE
3068
inhibitors
3069
decrease
3070
the
3071
risk
3072
of
3073
death
3074
following
3075
a
3076
recent
3077
MI
3078
by
3079
reducing
3080
cardiovascular
3081
mortality.
3082
Moreover,
3083
this
3084
analysis
3085
suggests
3086
that
3087
a
3088
reduction
3089
in
3090
SCD
3091
risk
3092
with
3093
ACE
3094
inhibitors
3095
is
3096
an
3097
important
3098
component
3099
of
3100
this
3101
survival
3102
benefit.
3103
In
3104
women,
3105
cholecystectomy
3106
leads

to
3108
the

3110

3113

3118
but

no

3145
However,
3146
future
3147

3148
that
3149

3150
the
3151
limitations
3152
in

the

3156
are
3157

RELEVANCE

TO
3593
CLINICAL
3594
PRACTICE:
3595
This
3596
review
3597
provides
3598
comprehensive
3599
understanding
3600
of
3601
the
3602
effectiveness
3603
of
3604
maternity
3605
support
3606
belts
3607
for
3608
the
3609
relief
3610
of
3611
low
3612
back
3613
pain
3614
during
3615
pregnancy
3616
which
3617
will
3618
facilitate
3619
healthcare
3620
professionals
3621
in
3622
providing
3623
evidence-based
3624
advice
3625
to
3626
their
3627
patients.
3628
Low

3632
gradually

increasing
3634
in
3635
intensity,
3636
duration
3637
and
3638
frequency
3639
may
3640
be
3641
an
3642
effective
3643
strategy
3644
in
3645
reducing
3646
fatigue
3647
in
3648
some
3649
adults
3650
with
3651
chronic
3652
auto-immune
3653
conditions.
3654
However,
3655
fatigue
3656
is
3657
a
3658
variable
3659
and
3660
personal
3661
experience
3662
and
3663
a
3664
range
3665
of
3666
behavioural
3667
interventions
3668
may
3669
be
3670
required.
3671
Well-designed
3672
studies
3673
testing
3674
these
3675
promising

3679
on

3681
fatigue
3682
measures
3683
are
3684
needed.
3685
The
3686
two
3687
treatments
3688
applied
3689
had
3690
similar
3691
effectiveness
3692
as
3693
they
3694
both
3695
relieved
3696
pain
3697
and
3698
reduced
3699
the
3700
size
3701
of
3702
recurrent
3703
aphthous
3704
ulcers.
3705
The
3706
cinnamon
3707
extract
3708
seems
3709
to
3710
have
3711
a
3712
moderate
3713
effect
3714
in
3715
reducing
3716

3717
plasma
3718

3728
systemic
3729
lupus
3730
erythematosus
3731

3732
course
3733
had
3734
effects
3735
in
3736
reducing

3738

3740
and

self-efficacy.
3746
The
3747
antiplatelet
3748

prehypertension
3768
and

3772
can
3773
sustain
3774
multiple

3777
that
3778
improve
3779
control
3780
of
3781
blood
3782
pressure
3783
and
3784
could
3785
reduce
3786
the
3787
risk
3788
for
3789
chronic
3790
disease.
3791
The

3794
not

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Recommendation

(Strength:
5772
Strong).
5773
Recommendation
5774
2:
5775
Opioids
5776
may
5777
be
5778
considered
5779
in
5780
the
5781
treatment
5782
of
5783
chronic
5784
LBP
5785
but
5786
should
5787
be

is
6472
insufficient

the

6477
of

whether
6490
this

Furthermore,
6507
in

the

6523
These

6525
are

strikingly
6527
similar

which
6538
a

6567
The

for

6596
but
6597
most

Atypical

6660
compared

6663
This

6665
should
6666
be
6667
considered
6668
within
6669
the

6700
might

be

an

reduced

the

6763
The
6764
efficacy
6765
of
6766
SAMe
6767
in
6768
treating
6769
depressive
6770
syndromes
6771
and
6772

6773
is
6774
superior
6775
with
6776
that
6777
of
6778
placebo
6779
and
6780
comparable
6781
to
6782
that
6783
of
6784
standard
6785
tricyclic
6786
antidepressants.
6787
Since
6788
SAMe
6789
is
6790
a
6791
naturally
6792
occurring
6793
compound
6794
with
6795
relatively
6796
few
6797

6798
it
6799
is
6800
a
6801
potentially
6802
important
6803
treatment
6804
for

6806
Further

Curcumin
6823
has

safe
6829
in
6830
six
6831
human
6832
trials
6833
and
6834
has
6835
demonstrated
6836
anti-inflammatory
6837
activity.
6838
It
6839
may
6840
exert
6841
its
6842
anti-inflammatory
6843
activity
6844
by
6845
inhibition
6846
of
6847
a
6848
number
6849
of
6850
different
6851
molecules
6852
that
6853
play
6854
a
6855
role
6856
in
6857
inflammation.
6858
Although
6859
more
6860
head-to-head
6861
clinical
6862
trials
6863
are
6864
needed
6865
for
6866
a
6867
direct
6868
comparison
6869
of
6870
AE
6871
frequency,
6872
these
6873
preliminary
6874
data
6875
from
6876
separate
6877
reports
6878
suggest
6879
the
6880
possibility
6881
that
6882
AEs
6883
may
6884
be
6885
less
6886
likely
6887
with
6888
doxycycline
6889
than
6890
minocycline.
6891
Counseling
6892
and
6893
pharmacotherapy
6894
can
6895
promote
6896
modest
6897
sustained
6898
weight
6899
loss,
6900
improving
6901
clinical
6902
outcomes.
6903
Pharmacotherapy
6904
appears
6905
safe
6906
in
6907
the
6908
short
6909
term;
6910
long-term
6911
safety
6912
has
6913
not
6914
been
6915
as
6916
strongly
6917
established.
6918
In
6919
selected
6920
patients,
6921
surgery
6922
promotes
6923
large
6924
amounts
6925
of
6926
weight
6927
loss
6928
with
6929
rare
6930
but
6931
sometimes
6932
severe
6933
complications.
6934
There
6935
is
6936
evidence
6937
of
6938
a
6939
significant
6940
reduction
6941
in
6942
mortality
6943
from
6944
AAA
6945
in
6946
men
6947
aged
6948
65

6950
79
6951
years
6952
who
6953
undergo
6954
ultrasound
6955
screening.
6956
These
6957
findings
6958
need
6959
careful
6960
consideration
6961
in
6962
judging
6963
whether
6964
a
6965
co-ordinated
6966
population-based
6967
screening
6968
programme
6969
should
6970
be
6971
introduced.
6972
Several
6973
aspects
6974
of
6975
screening
6976
have
6977
been
6978
inadequately
6979
studied
6980
to
6981
determine
6982
optimal
6983
methods,
6984
including
6985
which
6986
instrument
6987
to
6988
use,
6989
the
6990
age
6991
at
6992
which
6993

6994
screen,
6995
and
6996
which
6997
interval
6998
is
6999
most
7000
useful.

that

Electronic

8327
Future

8344
This

large

observational

data
8348

that

8368
In

general,
8370
the
8371
prognosis
8372
for
8373
spontaneous
8374

8375
is
8376
reasonable,
8377
with
8378
the
8379
exception
8380
of
8381
the
8382
subgroup
8383
(33.2%)
8384
with
8385
physical
8386
urticaria.
8387
These
8388
therapies
8389
may
8390
be
8391
most
8392
useful
8393
for
8394
highly
8395
symptomatic
8396
women
8397
who
8398
cannot
8399
take
8400
estrogen
8401
but
8402
are
8403
not
8404
optimal
8405
choices
8406
for
8407
most
8408
women.
8409
There
8410
is
8411
evidence
8412
that
8413
they
8414
are
8415
not
8416
more
8417
effective
8418
than
8419
placebo
8420
with
8421
respect
8422
to
8423

8424
functional
8425
status,
8426
or
8427
depression.
8428
We
8429
recommend
8430
making
8431
a
8432
diagnosis
8433
of
8434
androgen
8435
deficiency
8436
only
8437
in
8438
men
8439
with
8440
consistent
8441
symptoms
8442
and
8443
signs
8444
and
8445
unequivocally
8446
low
8447
serum
8448
testosterone
8449
levels.
8450
We
8451
recommend
8452
confirmation
8453
of
8454
the
8455
diagnosis
8456
by
8457
repeating
8458
the
8459
measurement
8460
of
8461
morning
8462
total
8463
testosterone
8464
and
8465
in
8466
some
8467
patients
8468
by
8469
measurement
8470
of
8471
free
8472
or
8473
bioavailable
8474
testosterone
8475
level,
8476
using
8477
accurate
8478
assays.
8479
Routine
8480
laboratory
8481
screening
8482
did
8483
not
8484
contribute
8485
substantially
8486
to
8487
the
8488
diagnosis
8489
of
8490
chronic
8491
urticaria
8492
or
8493
to
8494
the
8495
detection
8496
of
8497
underlying
8498
disorders.
8499
Lifestyle
8500
modification
8501
was
8502
exceptionally
8503
effective
8504
in
8505
preventing
8506
diabetes
8507
in
8508
older
8509
individuals;
8510
this
8511
finding
8512
was
8513
largely
8514
explained
8515
by
8516
greater
8517
weight
8518
loss
8519
and
8520
physical
8521
activity.
8522
As
8523
a
8524
group,
8525
however,
8526
despite
8527
initial
8528
symptom
8529
improvement
8530
during
8531
treatment
8532
that
8533
is
8534
largely
8535
maintained
8536
after
8537
treatment,
8538

8540
combined-type
8541

8542
exhibit
8543
significant

8545
in

8547
The

8549
is
8550
not

The

The

were
8971

that

9680
in
9681
the

9703
seems
9704
to

be

9720
Ankyloglossia,
9721
which
9722
is
9723
a
9724
relatively
9725
common
9726
finding
9727
in
9728
the
9729

population,
9731
adversely
9732
affects

selected

9737
Neither

nor
9741
a

topical
9743
steroid
9744
alone
9745
or
9746
in
9747
combination
9748
was
9749
effective
9750
as
9751
a
9752
treatment
9753
for

acute
9755
sinusitis
9756
in
9757
the
9758
primary

9760
setting.
9761
Currently
9762
there
9763
are
9764
relatively
9765
few
9766
studies
9767
of
9768
antidepressants
9769
for
9770
the
9771
treatment
9772
of

agitation
9774
and
9775
psychosis
9776
in
9777

9778
The
9779
SSRIs
9780
sertraline
9781
and
9782
citalopram
9783
were
9784
associated
9785
with
9786
a
9787
reduction
9788
in
9789
symptoms
9790
of
9791
agitation
9792
when
9793
compared
9794
to
9795
placebo
9796
in
9797
two
9798
studies.
9799
Both
9800
SSRIs
9801
and
9802
trazodone
9803
appear
9804
to
9805
be
9806
tolerated
9807
reasonably
9808
well
9809
when
9810
compared
9811
to
9812
placebo,
9813
typical
9814
antipsychotics
9815
and
9816
atypical
9817
antipsychotics.
9818
Future
9819
studies
9820
involving
9821
more
9822
subjects
9823
are
9824
required
9825
to
9826
determine
9827
if
9828
SSRIs,
9829
trazodone,
9830
or
9831
other
9832
antidepressants
9833
are
9834
safe
9835
and
9836
effective
9837
treatments
9838
for
9839
agitation
9840
and
9841
psychosis
9842
in
9843
dementia.
9844
Evidence
9845
suggests
9846
that
9847
the
9848
mode
9849
of
9850
action
9851
of
9852
bupropion
9853
and
9854
nortriptyline
9855
is
9856
independent
9857
of
9858
their
9859
antidepressant
9860
effect
9861
and
9862
that
9863
they
9864
are
9865
of
9866
similar
9867
efficacy
9868
to
9869
nicotine
9870
replacement.
9871
Evidence
9872
also
9873
suggests
9874
that
9875
bupropion
9876
is
9877
less
9878
effective
9879
than
9880
varenicline,
9881
but
9882
further
9883
research
9884
is
9885
needed
9886
to
9887
confirm
9888
this
9889
finding.
9890
Atypical
9891
antipsychotic
9892
use
9893
is
9894
associated
9895
with
9896
an
9897
increased
9898
risk
9899
for
9900
death
9901
compared
9902
with
9903
nonuse
9904
among
9905
older
9906
adults
9907
with
9908
dementia.
9909
The
9910
risk
9911
for
9912
death
9913
may
9914
be
9915
greater
9916
with
9917
conventional
9918
antipsychotics
9919
than
9920
with
9921
atypical
9922
antipsychotics.
9923
There
9924
is
9925
no
9926
consistent
9927
evidence
9928
that
9929
anxiolytics
9930
aid
9931
smoking
9932
cessation,
9933
but
9934
the
9935
available
9936
evidence
9937
does
9938
not
9939
rule
9940
out
9941
a
9942
possible
9943
effect.
9944
In
9945
this

10019
We

founded

that

10050
there
10051
is

11864
Moreover,
11865
this

that

of

11885
In

11969
appeared
11970
to

they
12476
both

The

of

SAMe

in
15550
treating

with

that
15559
of

to

that

15569
Since

is
15572
a
15573
naturally
15574
occurring
15575
compound

a

potentially

important

15602
is
15603
indicated.
15604
Curcumin
15605
has
15606
been
15607
demonstrated
15608
to

15611
in

15615

15617
demonstrated
15618
anti-inflammatory
15619
activity.
15620
It
15621
may
15622
exert
15623
its
15624
anti-inflammatory
15625
activity
15626
by
15627
inhibition
15628
of
15629
a
15630
number
15631
of
15632
different
15633

15634
that
15635
play
15636
a
15637
role
15638
in
15639
inflammation.
15640
Although
15641
more
15642
head-to-head
15643
clinical
15644
trials
15645
are
15646
needed
15647
for
15648
a
15649
direct
15650
comparison
15651
of
15652
AE
15653

15654
these
15655
preliminary
15656
data
15657
from
15658
separate
15659
reports
15660
suggest
15661
the
15662
possibility
15663
that
15664
AEs
15665
may
15666
be
15667
less
15668
likely
15669
with
15670
doxycycline
15671
than
15672
minocycline.
15673
Counseling
15674
and
15675
pharmacotherapy
15676
can
15677
promote
15678
modest
15679
sustained
15680
weight
15681
loss,
15682
improving
15683
clinical
15684
outcomes.
15685
Pharmacotherapy
15686
appears
15687
safe
15688
in
15689
the
15690
short
15691
term;
15692
long-term
15693
safety
15694
has
15695
not
15696
been
15697
as
15698
strongly
15699
established.
15700
In
15701
selected
15702
patients,
15703
surgery
15704
promotes
15705
large
15706
amounts
15707
of
15708
weight
15709
loss
15710
with
15711
rare
15712
but
15713
sometimes
15714
severe
15715
complications.
15716
There
15717
is
15718
evidence
15719
of
15720
a
15721
significant
15722
reduction
15723
in
15724
mortality
15725

79
15733
years
15734
who
15735
undergo
15736
ultrasound
15737
screening.
15738
These
15739
findings
15740
need
15741
careful
15742
consideration
15743
in
15744
judging
15745
whether
15746
a
15747
co-ordinated
15748
population-based
15749
screening
15750
programme
15751
should
15752
be
15753
introduced.
15754
Several
15755
aspects
15756
of
15757

15758
have
15759
been
15760
inadequately

determine
15764
optimal

15766
including
15767
which
15768
instrument
15769
to
15770
use,
15771
the
15772
age
15773
at
15774
which
15775
to
15776
screen,
15777
and
15778
which
15779
interval
15780
is
15781
most
15782
useful.

The

16256
There

is
16258
a

for

further

The

Further

establish

whether
16430
this

16432
is

causal.
16434
The

16498
Currently
16499
available
16500
evidence
16501
weakly
16502
supports
16503
the

16505
that

16510
is

not

associated
16513
with

important
16515
cardiovascular
16516
effects.
16517
Patients
16518
and
16519
clinicians
16520
need
16521
large

16540
Although

the

17126
This

observational

In

17152
the

for

17157
is

reasonable,
17159
with

the

exception
17162
of
17163
the
17164

17165
(33.2%)
17166

17169
These
17170
therapies
17171
may
17172
be
17173
most
17174
useful
17175
for
17176
highly
17177

17178
women
17179
who
17180
cannot
17181
take
17182
estrogen
17183
but
17184
are
17185
not
17186
optimal
17187
choices
17188
for
17189
most
17190
women.
17191
There
17192
is
17193
evidence
17194
that
17195
they
17196
are
17197
not
17198
more
17199
effective
17200
than

placebo
17202
with
17203

17208
or

depression.
17210
We
17211
recommend
17212
making
17213
a
17214
diagnosis
17215
of
17216
androgen
17217

17218
only
17219
in

low

serum
17230
testosterone
17231
levels.
17232
We
17233
recommend
17234
confirmation
17235
of
17236
the
17237
diagnosis
17238
by
17239
repeating
17240
the
17241
measurement
17242
of
17243

17246
and
17247
in

some

17250
by

measurement
17252

accurate
17260

17261
Routine
17262
laboratory
17263

17264
did
17265
not
17266
contribute
17267
substantially
17268
to
17269
the
17270
diagnosis
17271
of
17272
chronic
17273
urticaria
17274
or
17275
to
17276
the
17277
detection
17278
of
17279
underlying
17280

17281
Lifestyle
17282
modification
17283
was
17284
exceptionally

in
17287
preventing
17288
diabetes
17289
in
17290
older
17291
individuals;
17292
this
17293
finding
17294
was
17295
largely
17296
explained
17297
by
17298
greater
17299
weight
17300
loss
17301
and
17302
physical

17304
As

17312

treatment,
17320
children
